# 📘 Learning DSA

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice code written in **C++**.  
I’m using this repo to track my learning, consistency, and problem-solving journey.

## 📂 Folder Structure

The repository is organized topic-wise:

- **2D vector/** – Problems related to 2D arrays & matrices  
- **function/** – Function-based problems and practice  
- **pointers/** – Pointer concepts and problems  
- **queue/** – Queue data structure implementations  
- **string/** – String manipulation problems  
- **subarray/** – Subarray-based problems  
- **linearsearch.cpp** – Linear search implementation
